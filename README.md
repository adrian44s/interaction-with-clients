# Interactions with clients

In this activity I track the flow of traffic that occurs when a web page is requested, how the IP address of the web page is resolved and how it is delivered. In addition I examine the information content of the PDU containing the outgoing and incoming information in relation to the osi model.

## Objectives

- Set filters for the list of events.

- Run a simulation.

- Access a specific PDU.

- Examine the PDU information from the other events to get an overview of the entire exchange process.
